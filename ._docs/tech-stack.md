## **11. Current Limitations (Without Working Cloud Functions)**

**‚ö†Ô∏è What Doesn't Work Properly:**
- **Counters may not update** (likes, followers, comments counts)
- **User profiles may not auto-create** on registration
- **Some real-time features** may be limited

**‚úÖ What Still Works:**
- **Authentication** (login/logout)
- **Video posting** and viewing
- **Basic social interactions** (like/comment/follow)
- **Direct messaging**
- **Search functionality**
- **Profile viewing**

---

This represents the **current functionality** that exists in your codebase right now. The app provides a complete social video platform experience similar to TikTok, with the main limitation being the non-functional Cloud Functions for automatic counter updates.
